  "summary": "The propositions predominantly focus on education and public health, particularly concerning drug abuse and sexual health education in schools.  Several proposals aim to integrate drug education programs (like PROERD) into school curricula at both primary and secondary levels,  and some suggest incorporating sex education and STD/STI prevention.  Other key areas addressed include amending the law governing the Telecommunications Services Universalization Fund to allocate resources to education and science/technology, and temporarily suspending debt payments for municipalities facing emergencies, modifying the Fiscal Responsibility Law. One proposition also standardizes general rules in private insurance contracts and revokes provisions from existing legislation."
